Apple is expensive
So is banana 
How then are we to keep our systems working 
When fruits are so expensive?
Are they any other ways to boost our immune systems?
But I really love fruits.
What do I do?
I do not like suppliments.

Watermelon is rich in vitamins
Has a lot of Water
It's seeds is chewable
it is expensive


I love mangoes
they are rich and juicy
mangoes looks appealing to the eye
but are quite expensive
